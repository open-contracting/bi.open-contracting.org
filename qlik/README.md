## Translations

Each country whose source language is not English has a Google Spreadsheet with their translations from English to the source language. Currently:

- [Afghanistan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14-rdPF8t6zz3Dwf6aX5Lsw84v8pjWh8g5S9ykvJHYA4/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Chile](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hpIYuT44x67Q-D2c6DnE_2QPefNcKEsKtubI0LZ9fEU/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Moldova](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KchpTh0l24Ho793ekWiCmFyo5miIc9HjLosgdWSGxRU/edit?usp=sharing)

To make changes, you need to look up the "Translations" and "Translations Help" sheets. Please do not overwrite lines marked as restricted.
The BI tool receives the translation data from these sheets daily so that any translation changes appear in the tool the next day.
